In this notebook we have implemented the smile detection and finger detection using CNN with sequation and functional api of the tensorflow keras

**#CNN_smile_detection**

It's a implementation for smart lock opening system. Whenever person smile at the camera it'll open the door. Otherwise door will be remaining close. By implemntating camera to any embedded system we can achieve this. Here I trainied a  CNN model with keras sequential API. which resulted 80% accuracy and can predicted whether person smiled or not

# CNN_fingers_detection


![fingers](https://github.com/ajithpinninti/CNN_fingers_detection/blob/main/images/SIGNS.png)
It's a way for sign language detection. Here we implemented CNN model with Keras Functional API. Which can detect the number of fingers, We can use this model for human computer interaction.
